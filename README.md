# YASNAC ERC Interface Tools

This repository is a collection of libraries and programs for working with the very old YASNAC **ERC-series** industrial robots. The project is currently divided into "disk" and "remote" components.

- The disk code emulates an ERC-series disk drive and allows files to be loaded and stored to a PC instead of an ancient single density floppy disk.

- The remote code is for interfacing with the ERC-series robot directly as a connected PC. In addition to job transfer, this enables remote operation of utility functions and state queries. A number of helper programs are included. The bulk of the code is in the erc.py library.

## motomove

A program for directly commanding the ERC manipulator over the serial link. Utilized the un-/under- documented ERC MOVL system control command. Has the optional ability to power the servos up before the motion and then optionally power them down after. The program will block until the motion is complete.

### Usage

	usage: motomove [-h] [--speed [SPEED]] [--power {on,off,onoff}] [-d] position
	
	Connect to an ERC-series robot and move the manipulator
	
	positional arguments:
	  position              The position to move the robot into. Must be in
	                        rectangular coordinates and comma separated:
	                        x,y,z,tx,ty,tz. tx,ty,tz are tool list angles in
	                        degrees. If you don't want to specify a particular
	                        value, leave it empty. You can specify deltas, such as
	                        +=10.1,-=5,/=3,*=2 for movement relative to the robot's
	                        current position. NOTE: The resulting values won't be
	                        sanity-checked!
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  --speed [SPEED]       The speed at which the robot is to perform the motion,
	                        in mm/s. Allowable values are from 0.1 to 1200.00. The
	                        default is a glacial and safeish 10.0. BE SAFE.
	  --power {on,off,onoff}
	                        Controls servo power; a value of "on" will activate
	                        servo power in order to perform the motion, a value of
	                        "off" will turn the servo power off after performing
	                        the motion, a value of "onoff" will both activate the
	                        servo power before the motion and deactivate the servo
	                        power after the motion is complete. The default is not
	                        to make any change to the state of servo power.
	  -d, --debug           Enable transaction debugging output
	
	If you see a "too few arguments" error, try adding "--" before your position
	argument. For example: motomove -- "coordinates"

### Examples:

	motomove -- "+=10,+=20,+=30"
	motomove --speed=600 -- "-195.725,222.899,1671.442,14.65,-27.77,148.86"
	motomove --power onoff -- "*=2,*=1.5,/=2"

## motofile

A program for sending, receiving, deleting, and listing files on an ERC-series robot. There are options that enable both local and remote overwriting of files (which are disabled by default); also options for changing the format of file list output.

### Usage

	usage: motofile [-h] [--overwrite] [-s [SEPARATOR]] [-d]
	                {list,get,put,delete} [filename]
	
	Get or put files on a YASNAC ERC series robot
	
	positional arguments:
	  {list,get,put,delete}
	                        Specifies the file operation to be performed: "list"
	                        prints a list of files on the robot, "get" or "put"
	                        transfer the named file, "delete" removes the named
	                        file from the robot
	  filename              The name of the file to get, put, or delete
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
	  --overwrite           Allow new files to overwrite existing files with the
	                        same name
	  -s [SEPARATOR], --separator [SEPARATOR]
	                        When listing files, print them separated by the given
	                        argument, or null if you specify 0. The default
	                        separator is newline.
	  -d, --debug           Enable transaction debugging output


### Examples

List files on the robot:

	motofile list

Get or put a file on the robot:

	motofile get DEMO.JBI
	motofile get DEMO.JBR
	motofile --overwrite put DEMO.JBI
	
Delete a file from the robot:

	motofile delete DEMO

## motodisk

A server that provides a serial emulation of the YASNAC FC1 floppy disk drive.


### Usage

	usage: motodisk.py [-h] [-d] [-o] [file [file ...]]
	
	MotoDisk: a software emulator for the YASNAC FC1 floppy disk drive
	
	positional arguments:
	  file             optional: if you want only certain file(s) to be available
	                   to the robot, list those files on the command line. For
	                   example this allows you to send just a single file instead
	                   of all job (.JBI) files in the current working directory
	
	optional arguments:
	  -h, --help       show this help message and exit
	  -d, --debug      enable debugging output
	  -o, --overwrite  enable existing files to be overwritten by the program


### Todo

- add some tests
- disk: create a new exception specifically for the cancel message. IOError is the wrong answer for such a large diverse block
